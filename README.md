# Gladiators
## A turn-based game developed by Sascha Villing and Sebastian Voigt

This repository contains the game's web-frontend, using the Scala Play Framework and Vue JS.

Gladiators was created as an assignment for the courses 'Software Engineering', 'Software Architectures' and 'Web Technology' at the HTWG Konstanz.
The corresponding lectures are held by Prof. Marco Boger.
